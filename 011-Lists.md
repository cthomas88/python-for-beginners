# Lists

## What are lists in Python?

A list is a collection of data and can be applied to a variable. Lists can comprise of integers, floats and strings. The elements of a list are indexed and have a specific order, meaning you can access specific items within a list using its index number (which always starts at 0 for the first item).
You can also print a particular variable from a particular list
An example is illustrated below
Fruits=[Orange,mango,guava,pineapple,apple,waterlemon,banana]
To print a fruit from the list(fruits),we use the print statement+fruits+index of the fruit[-]
Note that index of any list starts from 0.

#Printing from lists
If we have a list and we want to print from that particular list,we use the print statement+name of the list+index of the value in the list tho index starts from zero(0)
E.g
Animals=[dog,goat,horse,lion,elephant,hen,donkey]
To print lion from list(Animals),
We use-print Animals[3]
To print dog,
We use-print Animals[0]
