#Using if statements
E.g to confirm a name that is (ibrahim) lets use an if statement
We first ask the user to input name
We then check if the name entered is ibrahim
The program should print(wrong name) if the name entered is not(ibrahim)
         Soln
Line 1- Name=input('enter name:')
Line 2- if (Name=='ibrahim'):
Line 3-    print('The name is',Name)
Line 4- else:
Line 5-      print('wrong name')
