#what is a for loop?
A for loop in python is used to repeat a series of instructions until a particular condition is met
It can be used for fixed iterations also.
It must be indented at the end just like if statements
An example is shown below
#using for loops
E.g lets try printing numbers from 1 to 20 using for loop
1.We first put in our values in the range we want to print them
E.g (start,stop)
Note that the stop value stops at the value before the original value
I.e if we are to print 1 to 10,we stop at 11 instead
2.We then print
       Soln
1.for i in range(1,21):
Print(i)
#This program after running displays numbers from 1 to 20
